# Why this project?
This project is my practical introduction to Language processing. Each letter in a chosen language has a corresponding probability - how likely one is to encounter it in an arbitrary text in that language. In this small project, te program uses character frequencies to determine whether a piece of text is written in English or Spanish. It does it by comparing the frequencies of the letters in the input text to the anticipated frequencies.
